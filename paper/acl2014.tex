\begin{abstract}
MCTest is a recently developed test for evaluating Machine Comprehension. Our approach to the task is through textual similarity and shallow methods. We build a simple bag-of-words baseline and we enhance it through additional pre-processing (i.e. coreference resolution, hypernym). We build a set of features and train a logistic classifier that we use to score multiple-choice answers. Finally we show how the introduction of simple matching rules system outperform current results on the MCTest.
