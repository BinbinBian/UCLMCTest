The initial pre-processing stage used the Stanford Parser \cite{stanford_parser} and Stanford Dependencies \cite{de2008stanford} to obtain phrase-structure and dependency trees for each story, along with its questions and answers. We also made use of the lemmatization and Penn part-of-speech (POS) tagging \cite{marcus1993building} provided by this system.

This toolkit performed well on the given data, due to the intentional linguistic simplicity of the stories. Of the few inconsistencies, the majority were due to incorrect recognition of invented brand names (e.g. ``Cookies n' Cr\'{e}me'' and ``Friendly-O's'') and the inability to categorize some subordinate dependencies. However, such cases were rare, and the errors introduced at this pre-processing stage were negligible in the final results.
