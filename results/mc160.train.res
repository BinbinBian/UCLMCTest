It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home.

They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home.

 I used to be afraid of butterflies! It is true! Once, my mom took me to Seattle. There, we went to a special place. We went to the zoo! I saw lots of animals at the zoo. I saw bears. I saw tigers. I saw apes. I saw monkeys. I saw snakes. I loved seeing all these animals. They made me happy. We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they did n't even scare me. In fact, I like bugs. But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place. You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you. My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared. I was n't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere. My mom said I would be okay. My brother said I would be okay. They said butterflies were nice and beautiful. They said they would not hurt me. So I went in the room. Guess what? I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop. He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies. I said I was sorry, but I was scared. He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there! I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies. Since then, they would tease me about being afraid. They would try and get me to not be afraid. Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book. She bought one for my brother, too. I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother. It became really fun to do. Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed. I liked it.

One day Pouncer 's wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office. There were white kittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese and Cream center.
