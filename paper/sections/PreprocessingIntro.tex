Matching question-answer pairs with the story can be significantly improved by homogenising the format of all stories and question-answer strings. Our matching algorithms operate on raw textual tokens, which are lemmatized and stripped of all extraneous function words; however, this raw format is generated on-demand, rather than during the pre-processing stage, and we retained the deep grammatical structure of the text in order to dynamically alter the format based on certain question conditions.
%transform the two to become more {\em similar} to each other and removing words that are noise in the text.
%Previously discussed pre-processing of the text was removing stop words, tokenizing the text into sentences and into words, stemming words, and adding POS notation for which we used the Stanford Parser\footnote{Some note on the Stanford parser}
%TODO

We focused on three pre-processing stages: syntactic parsing and co-reference resolution, hypernym and synonym annotation and answer statement generation.
