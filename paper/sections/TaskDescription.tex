The MCTest dataset consists of two collections of fictional stories, MC160 and MC500, containing 160 and 500 stories respectively with 4 questions per story and 4 multiple choice answers for each question, all of which were written by workers using Amazon Mechanical Turk.  The first collection of stories (MC160) was manually curated for quality by \cite{mctest}, whereas the second collection (MC500) was constructed by workers who had been pre-screened using a grammatical test and the stories were then rated for quality by new workers. MC500 also stipulated that workers include two incorrect answers in the story, to ensure that questions are not trivially answerable. The dataset is open-domain, however the concepts and vocabulary used within the stories and questions are limited to those which are understandable by a 7 year old, hence they may have fictional settings (e.g. {\em giraffes going to parties}) and require common sense knowledge.
