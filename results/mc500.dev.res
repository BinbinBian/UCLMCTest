 One sunny morning, Stewart chose to go to the beach. He knew that a rainstorm was going to arrive on Saturday and wanted to enjoy some sun before it arrived. Stewart laid on his belly and began reading his newspaper. As he was enjoying the sun and the newspaper, he saw a bug crawl across his blanket. At first Stewart thought it was an ant, but the bug was moving too slowly to be an ant. As Stewart leaned in for a closer look, the bug cried out, `` Excuse me, sir! Can you help me? '' Stewart was surprised and jumped to his feet. `` You can talk! '' he shouted. `` Yes, '' said the bug. `` Please help me! As you might know, there is a rainstorm coming into town. Unfortunately, I do not have a place to call home. I need to find somewhere to sleep before the rain washes me away! '' Stewart felt sad. `` Gee, '' he cried. `` That sounds terrible! '' Stewart thought about the problem. `` Perhaps you can stay at my house, '' he said. The bug jumped for joy and said, `` Oh, that would be wonderful! '' The two traveled back to Stewart 's house and the bug found a soft spot to sleep. The next day, the sky had darkened and rain clouds appeared all over town. Just as the news had said, a rainstorm had arrived. When Stewart woke up, he looked for the bug but could not find him. Then, he saw something flying around his house. `` Thank you for letting me sleep here last night, '' said the butterfly. It was the bug! `` I knew I could not change into a butterfly if I was out in the rain. I wo n't forget your kindness. '' After speaking, the butterfly flew away.

'' I asked. `` Not much, '' he said. `` I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste. '' `` Sure, little guy, '' I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out.

 Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles ' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles was n't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better. After that, whenever he would see a duck, Toodles would run the other way.

 I do n't think I can win the race Tim told his parents over breakfast. His mother asked `` Why not? '' but his father was silent. Tim knew his father did n't believe he could be a racer: only last year, he had sent Tim to a doctor to ask why his son was n't a better runner. The doctor told him Tim could be anything he wanted to be, and maybe he did n't like to run. Tim, who had always preferred a good book to P.E. class, wanted to show his family that he really could be what they wanted him to be, so he spent his allowance on a pair of green running shoes and signed up for his school 's Spring Fun Run. Tim answered, `` I 'm going to try to win, but Angela is so quick! No one ever beats her at recess. '' `` Well, we 'll be there for you, either way '' his mother said. Tim took an apple and walked to the bus. Since the race was after school today -LRB- school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15 -RRB-, he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. He did n't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named Simon that Tim sometimes pretended to be. 3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. All the other students had brought running shorts, but Tim was going to have to run in his school pants. Suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. As he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. By the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. It was almost 4:00 before Tim saw the end of the run. By the time Tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. Tim 's father asked, `` What took you so long? I 'm surprised to see you here at all! Why did you sign up for this when we all knew you would n't win? '' Tim thought about why he signed up. It was n't about winning the race, or making his father proud. It was about finishing, and showing himself that the doctor was right: he could be anything he wanted to be, like his favorite character, Simon.

Questions:

Q: Why does Tim start out so far behind?

A0: He trips over his shoelace.
A1: He is knocked down.
A2: He gets sick.

A0: 3:15
A1: Tim does n't know
A2: 4:00
A3: 3:30

Q: Why does Tim run the race?

A0: To make Angela like him.
A1: To win a prize.
A2: Because his father wants him to.
A3: To show that he could be anything he wanted to be.

 Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They do n't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous. It 's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that 's what is most important! Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice.

 The bird by the river chirped twice before breaking into song, to tell all the other animals to sing along. The dog barked, the other birds sang, the squirrel squeaked, and the rabbit clapped its ears together. The cat did not because his mouth was hot from some very strong mustard. He thought to himself that he would n't have eaten that hot dog if he knew it was on it. He tried to look for water, but that mustard drove his nose crazy and he could n't smell anything. Not even water. Luckily for the cat, cats have very good eyes, and he saw a puddle out of the corner of his eye. He ran to it. He wondered why the water was kind of yellow, and thought it must be from the leaves floating in the puddle. The cat took a big drink. It made his tongue felt so much better that it made him want to sing, but the others were done and the bird had flown away.

 I stepped inside my mother 's car and dropped my backpack on the floor as my face filled with excitement. Today 's the day that we 're going to the candy store and picking out a new treat to have after dinner. Some people may like going to the movies, or the game room, or even to parks, but going to the candy store once a week and getting to see all the different colors and taste all the different treats is my favorite activity. As soon as we pull up, she tells me to not run around too much inside, but I 'm so excited I barely hear her. She opens the door and we walk inside where the clerk first welcomes us. Since we do this each week, he calls me by my name of Trevor and says that he 's come up with a few candies for me to try. I walk over to the table and see three types of M&M 's laid out. He knows I 'm not a big fan of peanuts so he left out the peanut kind, instead giving me mint flavored, cookies 'n creme flavored, and white chocolate flavored. They all taste great and the clerk asks which I like the most. It takes me a bit to choose, but I finally choose the Mint as this week 's choice. He rings us up at the front desk and says that since we buy from his shop so much, he 's going to give us a sale, so we think it 'll be a nickel or a dime or even a quarter off.
